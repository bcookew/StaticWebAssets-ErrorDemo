# StaticWebAssets Error Repro

## Purpose

This is a minimal repro of an issue I am having with how to handle static web assets from multiple WASM projects.

## Additional Information
I am aware that this is probably a lack of knowledge on my part however I think updating the Blazor Docs with clearer guidance would be helpful.
Here is a [link](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/31780)https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/31780) to the issue I filed on the `Static Assets` documentation requesting further guidance.
